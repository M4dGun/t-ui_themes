==========================

### 🔍✏️ INFO:

**WEATHER**: the weather (via custom_command) should automatically recognize your location, otherwise open the expert.xml file and in the penultimate line add your city, for example:
<custom_command value = "curl -s w ttr.in/Florence?0T" />

**ICONS**: if you don't want to see the (alias) application icons, open my alias.txt file and delete the first 13 lines.

**GROUPS**: This theme takes advantage of the very useful function of application groups. 
I created 7 groups: Tools; Social; Miui; Games; Root; Media; Google.
To change the names, open the apps.xml file and change the initial uppercase name : <TOOLS apps =
The file also contains apps that I have already included in some categories.
You can add as many applications as you want with the command:
apps -addtogp GROUPname APPname
to create a group, type: 
apps -mkgp groupNAME

**TO-DO**: if you use my alias, you can use notes with the todo and showtodo commands, try!
